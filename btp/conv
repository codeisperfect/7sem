****PS : I do web-development.. not designing..
it is just a abstration to devide the code in two part..
Just like in shell ( OS ) =>
 1. render_state  ( Called view ) [ Draw the secne given a state ] 
2. shell state (Called controller ) ( everything...  &  every calculation.. & calculate render state..  )

Are... ese code mt send kra kro.. Attach file..
btw.. this code will redirect the page to google in 5 sec.
oh.. u want to refresh google news page ?
oh.. That u are not allowed to do..
Let me think a jogad for it.
ohk...
So Jogad[0] : <start>
Install python selenium (Firefox ), write a small code to open given url & in that code use a simple python while (True)  loop with time.sleep(5)
& open that url every time.
& finally alias it
alias mybrowser='python code.py'
& then chil..
It will open new window of firefox.. where u can do whatever u want.. just like normal firefox window.
Additionally , other then normal user interface, you can give command from python code. Like .. click on some link.. or whatever...
Raghuvanshraj Saxena
23/06/2015 07:42

That's OK
